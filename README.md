# ARC Ruleset

## What is Advanced Robot Combat?

Are you a fan of combat robotics? When you watch a match, do you think to yourself "why don't they just..." or "I bet this design would be unstoppable, if I could only build it"? ARC is the place to put your ideas to the test! We won't put you on TV, but you'll be competing against the best theoretical robots around.

### How does it work?

We regularly run tournaments on advancedrobotcombat.com (and sometimes on reddit) and we'd love to have you join. To enter a tournament, you'll need a picture of your design(s), a description of what your robot does, and a set of stats (we'll get into those shortly.) Many people use CAD software to render their ideas, but others draw them by hand or even build them out of LEGO.

Once the tournament starts, you'll have a weekly match (or matches, depending on the tournament) against other participants. Each of you will write up a short summary of the strategy you'll use against your opponent and how you plan to defeat them, and then our team of experienced writers will figure out whose strategy and design wins them the match, writing up a short summary of how the fight went.

We have a few rules we'll ask you to follow when writing your strategies ("RPs"):

* Post your strategy before the tournament's deadline. If you miss the deadline, that's a forfeit.
* Don't read your opponent's strategy before you write yours. This is considered cheating and we take it very seriously.
* Don't be a jerk. Insulting or bullying other players and throwing tantrums if you lose is not okay.
* Declare your robot's configuration, if it has more than one. Do this is your RP and let your opponent know what you're going to use ahead of time as required by the tournament.
* Respect the word limit. Don't make the writers read an essay on why your robot is the best, either: a concise strategy is better than a rambling one.

In addition to our website, we have a great community on Discord where we'd be happy to help you improve your designs.

## Stats: An Overview

To simulate the limitations of building to a weight limit, we give each robot 30\* points to divide between speed, traction, torque, weapon, and armor. Finding the right stat line for your robot can be one of the trickier parts of ARC, but veteran players will be glad to help you figure it out.

\* Some tournaments allow shuffling and walking robots extra points.

Here's a quick summary of what each of the stats affects:

* **Speed** - how fast your robot goes.
* **Traction** - how grippy your wheels (or tracks, etc.) are, and as a result how easy your robot is to drive in a controlled manner. Additionally, how far your robot will be knocked back by impacts.
* **Torque** - how fast you can push other robots, and how quickly your robot accelerates.
* **Weapon** - how powerful your robot's weapon is.
* **Armor** - how strong your robot's armor is.

## Mobility

Your robot's drivetrain is described by its speed, traction, and torque stats. Your robot is required to have at least one point in each of these three stats. 

Speed is pretty simple: if you put 5 points in speed, your robot will travel at 5 "units of distance" per second. Speed also determines how quickly your robot can turn. 

To keep your robot controllable, you'll want to keep traction pretty close to speed. If your robot has equal speed and traction stats, it has "perfect control" and will drive as you intend it to. If traction is one less than speed, you'll have some minor oversteering. Two less, and you'll have frequent oversteering. With a difference of three or more, you'll have difficulty controlling it. Having greater traction than speed has little benefit, apart from lower knockback on impacts.

Putting points in torque means you can push other robots around more quickly: 4 points in torque would let you push at 4 speed (assuming you have at least 4 speed.) You'll push at a slower speed if your opponent is pushing in the opposite direction.

More torque also means you'll accelerate faster. With one point in torque, it will take your robot two seconds to reach top speed from a full stop. Each additional point in torque halves that time: a robot with 3 torque would reach full speed in half a second.

### Movement Types

While most robots use wheels, there are other options as well, with advantages and disadvantages.

* **Wheels** are the most common option. A robot with 2 wheels will drive a little differently from one with 4, but how many you want is up to you.
* **Tank treads** reduce how much you'll be knocked back by impacts, but are more fragile.
* **Mecanum or Omniwheels** allow you to strafe side to side, but halve your effective torque and increase how much you'll be knocked back by impacts.
* **Shuffling mechanisms** and **walking mechanisms** often come with an increased point limit (depending on the tournament) but reduce your maximum speed and cause your robot to wobble as it moves. Check your tournament rules for specifics on how these are handled.
* **Exotic movement systems** such as gyroscopic procession and slithering robots should be handled with care. Check with the tournament organizer if you want to enter a robot that uses a movement system not covered here.
